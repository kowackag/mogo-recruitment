### **Solutions provided in the project:**

- HTML:
  - The project was built using semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS:
  - The css styles (`client.css` and` admin.css`) are loaded into `<head>` section thanks to `webpack`, using the appropriate loader in `webpack.config.js` for files with the extension` .css`.
  - The form was made using CSS Grid layout.
  - It was prepared with Mobile-first approach.
